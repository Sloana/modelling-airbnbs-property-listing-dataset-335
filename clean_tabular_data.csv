0,f9dcbd09-32ac-41d9-a0b1-fdb2793378cf,Treehouses,Red Kite Tree Tent - Ynys Affalon, Escape to one of these two fabulous Tree Tents. Suspended high above the canopy it‚Äôs time to appreciate life from a new perspective. Featured on George Clarke‚Äôs Amazing Spaces these Tree Tents are a feat of aviation technology. Tree Tent comes complete with fire pit outdoor kitchen and shower with hot water. You‚Äôll discover a comfortable bed and cosy wood burning stove. Part of the Red Kite Estate along with our barn and its sister tree tent the first ever built in the UK Dragons Egg. The space The space\nThe true joy of this place is how wonderfully simple it is (aviation technology aside). Days are filled with fireside discussions wildlife watching and stunningly beautiful walks. With the nearest mobile signal a ten minute walk away it‚Äôs a great place to ditch the digital and truly escape. Head over the bridge to your own private deck that happily houses a clever outdoor-kitchen and shower (complete with hot water). It‚Äôs the perfect spot to fry up breakfast whilst basking in peace and tranquility. There is also a flushing toilet situated just up the hill.And don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre not totally left to your own devices on arrival you can expect bed linen towels and a load of dry wood and kindling. If you feel the need to leave your new found homestead in the trees then the local area has lots of suitably chilled things to do. Head out on a moorland walk to take in some magical views - and perhaps even grab a pint at the local pub en route. Further afield the stunning Elan Valley a landscape bursting with impressive dams and reservoirs is well worthy of an explore. And for those needing supplies - and perhaps a flat white - then the friendly market town of Builth Wells is just down the road.Other things to note\nYou are entering a remote woodland hideaway for a digital detox: there is very patchy mobile signal and limited internet connectivity.,"['What this place offers', 'Bathroom', 'Shampoo', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Heating and cooling', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Services', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Wifi\nWifi', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer']",Llandrindod Wells United Kingdom,2.0,1.0,1.0,105,4.6,4.7,4.3,5.0,4.3,4.3,13,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/26620994?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8188&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-03-19&check_out=2022-03-26&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=eebf9d56-f119-426a-b39b-9d89928069dc,1.0

From this central spot by the river easily explore the trails and river. Then relax on the deck and enjoy the magic of the trees.\n\n‚Ä¢Airbnb ‚ÄúTop 20 Places to Stay in VA‚Äù\n‚Ä¢Best of Richmond by Style Magazine\n‚Ä¢Featured in Airbnb article on hospitality\n‚Ä¢One of 8 Great Airbnbs in the U.S. by Inside Hook\n\n‚Ä¢Complementary bikes\n‚Ä¢Comes with bathroom kitchenette & lounge apartment in host house\n‚Ä¢Dog-friendly\n\nSocial media: @trailside_treehouse The space The space\nWhen you stay in the treehouse you‚Äôre not just embarking on an incredible adventure for your family‚Äîyou‚Äôre also helping the Richmond-area community by supporting non-profits that are aligned with our mission of supporting children and the outdoors. We donate a large portion of your payment to local non-profits and thank you for being a positive part of our community.\n\n~~\n\nHeres your chance to fulfill that childhood dream of running away and camping out in a treehouse. This is not a tiny house wrapped around a tree or a glamorous treehouse complete with running water and a kitchen. Instead this is an authentic treehouse that we built for our nephew in 2014 complete with reclaimed redwood walls and windows from our old house. Its an authentic kid-like treehouse experience; a space devoted to the stuff of childhood dreams.\n\nLOCATION: The Trailside Treehouse is centrally located in Richmond Virginia just minutes from I-95 and I-64. It is directly across the river from one of Richmonds popular parks called Maymont. The James River Park System and Buttermilk Trail also come through the property thanks to an easement we have given the city. The treehouse property itself includes five wooded acres with nationally-celebrated single-track trail and is adjacent to the river--just hike down the trail and cross a single train track and youll find some of Richmonds best fishing and swimming!\n\nTHE SPACE: As we designed the treehouse space we asked ourselves one question: what would we have wanted in a treehouse as kids? The Trailside Treehouse is our answer to that question--its a magnum opus to childhood.\n\nPlease note: There is a zipline on the property. Per our insurance company guests are not allowed to use it. Please prepare your children ahead of time so theyre not bummed when they arrive!\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT: The treehouse isn‚Äôt an inexpensive place to stay. It‚Äôs not simply a comfortable room to call home as you pass through town as are many Airbnb‚Äôs. Instead it‚Äôs an unparalleled experience that we hope transforms our guests by bringing them back to their childlike centers. It‚Äôs a place to practice juggling or learn new yo-yo tricks. It‚Äôs a place to flip through a book about bowling rules and get curious about things you haven‚Äôt wondered about since you were a kid. There are notes to discover in the nooks and crannies. There are games you may not have played with since you were a child. Theres a bin of junk food and a fridge with sodas. Weve stocked the treehouse with activities that we hope reminds you of the curiosity you had as a child. We want you to feel that your time here is invaluable‚Äîthat it is a priceless trip that sets you up for a transformative week or month or year. Reinvigorates. Rejuvenates. Renews your very sense of self.\n\nVALUABLE MEMORIES TO LAST A LIFETIME\nWe know the treehouse experience is an investment that many families save for. Our goal is to provide you with value beyond your expectations so that you truly feel that your time exploring here with your friends and family was worth every cent. Our guests who get the most value from the experience are those guests who are willing to leave their phones in their bags and truly live in the simplicity and wonder of the moment. We want you to imagine that you are your 10-year old self and have packed a backpack with all of your favorite things and run away to your neighbors treehouse in the woods. Even those guests bringing kids should feel ready to loosen the reigns of responsibility for awhile to just enjoy the space and get optimum value from their time here.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nDESIGN AND TOUR HISTORY\nThis two-story treehouse was designed by renowned Richmond architect Henry Tenser and modeled after a western firetower. It was featured (alongside the modern home where the hosts live) on the 2017 Virginia Home and Garden Tour as well as three Westover Hills Neighborhood Association tours and the Modern Richmond Tour.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nTRAILSIDE LOCATION IN THE CITY\nThe treehouse sits in our back yard at the top of a wooded gully that leads to the James River Park System and is mere yards from the popular Buttermilk Trail--one of the most celebrated urban single-track trail systems in the entire country. For trail-lovers and adventure-lovers you simply cant find a better spot to stay the night in Richmond Virginia.\n\n**please note that we are located within the city so you can expect to hear city sounds which may include trains sirens traffic and other things.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nBRIDGE TO CHILDHOOD\nTo access the treehouse youll cross a wooden bridge and enter onto the main deck. If youre ready to play jump into the twisty tube slide and play on the playground equipment beneath the main floor. If youre ready to relax take a seat on the deck and enjoy your wooded surroundings.\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nPORCH LEVEL\nEnter the main floor screened porch through the screened doors. The main floor is screened in on all four sides and features two hammock swings--the perfect place to read a book or recount your day on the trail as you rock amongst the trees--mosquito-free (a rare summer treat for Richmond).\n\nWhen more than 4 people wish to stay in the treehouse this first floor can be transformed into an additional sleeping area with a fold-up memory foam mattress or single cots. Just let us know if you need those!\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\nSLEEPING LEVEL\nThe sleeping area on the second story is located up a knee-hole ladder and through a trap door. The second story is surrounded by windows on all four sides including two fish-eye windows so you can poke your head into the concave plexiglass and get a look at the ground three stories below. The second story also features a balcony which is accessible through a screen door. Youll sleep soundly under the corrugated corten steel roof. The sleeping quarters features a queen bed with a memory foam mattress and a bunkbed cot.\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\nLOUNGE BATHROOM AND KITCHENETTE\nInside the host house youll have full private use of our basement which includes a temperature-controlled lounge area with a TV sleeper sofa bean bag chair kitchenette with sink microwave and Keurig and full bathroom.

Garden spigot water comes from rainwater collected from the roof. Other things to note Other things to note\nsummer guests‚Äî yes it can be hot. Again think of the treehouse of your childhood dreams. It doesn‚Äôt have ac! Overnight temps are typically in the 70s and we have fans. If you need temperature controlled environments plan to spend time and sleep in the basement lounge of the host house. If summer glamping isn‚Äôt appealing book your stay in the spring or fall when temps are milder. :)\n\nWinter guests: see above only opposite.\n\nSingle night options are sometimes available. Contact us if you\d like to book just one night.\n\nPlease‚Äîno candles or open flames in the treehouse including grills or propane cooktops.\n\nRIVER ACCESS‚ÄîThe treehouse property includes five wooded acres with trails for you to explore. A train track borders our property to the north and just on the other side of the track is a popular river swimming and fishing spot. You can hike to the river easily and spend a day enjoying swimming floating fishing water sports and exploring. Rock hopping is very popular in Richmond.\n\nFOOD ODORS‚ÄîPlease no fish or fragrant food/items in the treehouse or lounge. This includes cologne perfume fish fish incense fish and any other odors that may take a few days to air out especially but not limited to fish.\n\nZIPLINE‚ÄîThere is a zipline on the property. Per our insurance company guests are not allowed to use it. Please prepare your children ahead of time so they\re not bummed when they arrive!\n\nTRAIL ACCESS‚ÄîThe trail off of the treehouse property is a single track trail that leads to 40 miles of a nationally recognized trail system. It‚Äôs very technical for riders and should only be attempted by advanced riders. It‚Äôs great for hikers and runners at all levels. If you are borrowing treehouse bikes and want to ride the trail avoid the single track Buttermilk trail...you‚Äôll want to ride the bikes a mile downriver on the road to Reedy Creek to pick up the fire road which is flat and awesome for riders at all levels. From the fire road ride down river two miles to Belle Isle then circle the island or ride all over the city including the canal walk and Capital Trail. Togwatee‚Äîfrom here you can go anywhere!!\n\nBONFIRE‚ÄîWe have firewood lighters and fire starters. Plan to have a bonfire. You may want to bring your own starter log if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with starting a fire. The kind you‚Äôd use in a fireplace works!\n\nEGRESS AND LADDER‚ÄîThe sleeping quarters are up a ladder and through a 24x24 opening. Please be comfortable climbing the ladder and moving through the opening. If you\re pregnant you may want to measure your belly.\n\nWEATHER‚ÄîWe do not refund cancellations for weather reasons. Please be aware when booking that you could get inclement weather including storms snow wind etc. For that reason you need to be comfortable assuming some weather-related risk before you book.\n\nRESCHEDULING‚ÄîWe do allow guests to reschedule in some cases as long as they request the rescheduling 10 days prior to the day of stay or more.\n\nURBAN NOISES‚ÄîThe treehouse is located on five wooded acres in the center of Richmond City. Our property is only one of about a dozen riverside properties in the entire city so you will have easy access to the river while enjoying life in the trees. Along with lots of wildlife you will hear city sounds which we refer to in our family as ‚Äúurban waves‚Äù like the sounds of beach waves. These noises may include sirens trains and traffic along with all the sounds of nature and your loved one‚Äôs laughter and cheer.\n\nHOST FAMILY INTERACTION AND SPACE USE‚ÄîOur family lives in the property and our home is very close to the treehouse. Our family plays in the front yard when guests are in residence and we leave the back yard for guests to enjoy on their own. Guests should be comfortable and open to seeing our kids in the driveway and front yard. :)\n\nELECTRICITY LIMITATIONS‚ÄîThe treehouse is on a 20 AMP power circuit. If too many devices are plugged in and running the breaker may trip causing power loss. Please let us know right away if you lose power.\n\nHEATERS‚ÄîWe provide heaters that are approved by our insurance company. Please do not bring your own.\n\nHOT PLATES‚ÄîDue to safety concerns please do not use hot plates or other heating or cooking devices within the treehouse.\n\nGUEST COUNT‚ÄîPlease let us know in advance how many guests are in your party so we can set up the beds set out the appropriate number of towels and make sure there are enough snacks and drinks. We want everyone in your group to have an awesome experience. If we don‚Äôt know a guest is coming we won‚Äôt have set up a comfortable space for him/her and he/she will not have towels blankets pillows snacks drinks and all the fun stuff that makes glamping in the treehouse such a memorable experience. Thank you!\n\n\nWATER‚ÄîDrink water from the kitchen and sink faucets but not the garden spigots.

The Tree House is hand-crafted one of 3 casitas and 3 treehouses at the Bio Thermales natural resort organically integrated into our 35 acre rainforest. Guests enjoy free access from 9 am to 10 pm to the 15 natural hot and cool springs pools of various temperatures and rainforest trails. The space The space\nPlease message us if we will be your first or last destination in Costa Rica. We highly recommend booking on weekdays for more privacy and tranquility as we have more day visitors from 9 am to 6 pm to our hot springs on the weekends especially Sundays. If your reservation includes a Sunday we highly recommend planning a day outing to the many wonderful nearby activities.\n\nWe are three hours north of San Jose (airport) 45 minutes east of Fortuna and Volcano Arenal and the many activities there and nearby.\n\nGuests enjoy 24/day access* to our hot springs and trails in our 35 acre rainforest at no extra charge. The pools are cleaned every morning starting at 6 am but one hot spring will always be available. Many factors may dictate scheduling including weather. We do not charge for children 17 and under -- but we will not accept reservations for the Tree House for families with children under 5 years old for whom a 20 foot fall from the balcony would be very serious.\n\nOur hot springs are ancient ‚Äúdeep Earth‚Äù sources that bubble up through the rainforest floor laden with mineral-rich waters that have been in the Earth for at least 10000 years. Our waters are rich in bicarbonates calcium and magnesium low in sulfur and slightly acidic -- qualities shared by many of the world\s best hot springs.\n\nFive of our 9 organic form hot springs pools are located in the rainforest and 4 hot springs pools as well as a small and a large cool spring swimming pool are located in a meadow surrounded by rainforest (see below for more information). The small and large cool springs pools both have water slides and there is a small water slide in one of the shallow and moderate temperature pools for small children.\n\nThe Tree House is built to strict Costa Rican building codes but as with all tree houses there is some movement when the wind blows and this could be uncomfortable for people very sensitive to motion sickness.\n\nYou may see our other listings on Airbnb at:\n\nTucano Casita (Toucan Casita) is listed as Rainforest Casita with Hot Springs: airbnb.com/rooms/30358\n\nMariposa Casita (Butterfly Casita) is listed as Rainforest Casita2 with Hot Springs airbnb.com/rooms/51518\n\nColibri Casita (Hummingbird Casita) is listed as Rainforest Casita3 with Hot Springs\nairbnb.com/rooms/1896911\n\nTree House: Rainforest Tree House with Hot Springs airbnb.com/rooms/50435\n\nYou can check availability of each accommodation by clicking on the Calendar tab above the main photo on each listing.\n\nTree House features: (see floor-plan for all details):\n‚Ä¢ Perched high among the rainforest trees the Tree House has large screened areas for circulation of naturally cooler breezes.

Bio Thermales is generally not crowded however except on major holidays and Sundays.\n\nFood/Meals: The Tree House has a kitchen. There are many restaurants and a good supermarket within a 15 minute drive. Traditional Costa Rican meals can be delivered from a local caterer for very reasonable prices (Costa Rican food is tasty but not spicy). Otherwise for those without cars we can call a taxi or synchronize a food shopping trip when we go to town for errands.\n\nDriving from SJO airport: Please message us before booking if we are your first and/or last destination in Costa Rica.\n\nWe recommend at least a small 4 wheel drive car. The last 3 kilometers are country roads.\n\nThree hours of daylight are needed to safely drive here from the SJO airport before sunset at 5:30 pm. The drive through mountainous cloud forests is splendid in daylight but prone to fog and rain especially at night creating hazardous visibility conditions after dark. Finding our countryside location will also be far easier if you arrive the first time before sunset. If your plane lands in the morning to noon you can drive here directly from the airport. Otherwise it is safer to book a room near the airport on your first night or ask us to book a private driver ($145) and have a rental car delivered at no extra charge.\n\nLast night in Costa Rica:\nDriving directly to the SJO airport on the same day is possible if you book a flight in the afternoon. Please be aware that you must be at the airport 2.5 hours before departure. If you have an early morning departing flight it is basically necessary to stay near the airport on the night before. Guest access Guest access\nFive of our 9 organic form hot springs pools are located in the rainforest and 4 hot springs pools as well as a small and a large cool spring swimming pool(with water slides) are located in a meadow surrounded by rainforest and one cool fresh spring pool in the rainforest (see below for more information). Tree House guests can enjoy the hot springs pools from 9am to 10 pm and 35 acres of rainforest access at no charge. The pools are cleaned daily from 6 am to 9 am but one pool is always available -- there are many factors involved including weather that may dictate when the pools are ready. We have a staff operated laundry facility and guests may give clothes for washing/drying/folding for $5/load. Other things to note Other things to note\nDay visitors and groups are permitted entrance to use the hot springs and cool springs pools from 9 am to 6 pm. There are usually more day visitors on weekends especially Sundays and we recommend booking week days for more tranquility and privacy. If guests book a longer reservation that includes a Sunday we recommend planning a day tour in the many nearby activities on Sundays. Day visitors must leave by 6 pm and only casita and Tree House guests may use the pools after 6 pm and enjoy unlimited access to the pools with the exception of no nighttime use of the forest pools and cleaning schedule as noted above.\n\nWe recommend either ordering a catered dinner in advance for your first evening and/or next morning breakfast or buying and bringing groceries to cook because we are 4 km from the main paved road and driving after dark is highly discouraged until drivers have quite some experience on Costa Rican roads. Also most guests prefer to settle in upon arrival and not to have to get back in the car and drive out to dinner. We provide a Catering Menu to each guest once reserved but the caterer requires advance notice of selected meals and TIMES guests would like meals delivered. We do not have a liquor license and guests must bring their own beer/wine/rum etc. The tap water is safe to drink and we sell soft drinks fruit juices and other non-alcohol beverages snacks and ice cream.,"['What this place offers', 'Heating and cooling', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Home safety', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Barbecue utensils', 'Grill, charcoal, bamboo skewers/iron skewers, etc.', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Services', 'Self check-in', 'Keypad', 'Check yourself in to the home with a door code', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Kitchen\nKitchen', 'Unavailable: Wifi\nWifi', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Essentials\nEssentials', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'This place may not have a smoke detector.

Meals may be eaten at the picnic tables on the porch under the pavilion or you can take food back to your site. FOOD SCRAPS MUST BE PUT INTO THE COMPOST BIN ‚Äì NOT IN THE TRASH. Please do not discard food on the ground as it can make our animals sick and attract unwanted wildlife.\n\nTHE FARM: We are a farm in the mountains so we have all the good (beautiful views babbling brook hiking trails) and the bad (insects howling coyotes poison ivy) that nature has to offer so come prepared. We recommend hiking boots bug spray and weather-appropriate clothing. Be prepared to encounter INSECTS (mosquitoes ticks chiggers) WILDLIFE (deer turkey snakes toads and dare we mention the bear track we spotted one spring?) WEATHER (hot cold rain snow) TOXIC PLANTS (poison ivy stinging nettle wild mushrooms) just to name a few. There is a steep and rugged 1.5-mile hiking loop that takes most folks about an hour (if they can get past the first 10-minute uphill climb). We also have playground swings disc golf hula hoops a croquet set and a creek full of geodes to hunt.\n\nCAMPFIRES: Most sites have their own fire pit except for the primitive camping area. There is also a large communal fire pit near the Community Kitchen. Due to the spread of invasive insects we ask that you DO NOT BRING FIREWOOD unless it is store-bought/kiln dried. We have bundles for sale here for $5/bundle (bring cash) or you can scavenge dead wood from the forest floor for free. DO NOT cut down live trees and DO NOT burn plastic glass trash gas or anything that isn‚Äôt wood or paper. There is plenty of fire-starting materials under the Pavilion next to the bundles.

If the fire danger is high a campfire may not be advisable ‚Äì please check for local burn bans.\n\nSMOKING: Smoking is not permitted within the vicinity of any building on the farm. Please do not discard cigarette butts in the firepits or on the ground. They must be completely extinguished and can be thrown in the trash.\n\nTRASH: In case you missed it before we do not have trash pick-up on the farm and very much appreciate it if you can take your trash with you when you leave the farm.

Bicycles are welcome and encouraged.\n\nGENERATORS: We highly discourage the use of generators as they can be quite noisy and produce toxic fumes. Please talk to us in advance if you require one for a specific purpose.\n\nACCIDENTS: If a child or member of your party has an accident involving bodily fluids please take the time to clean up after them. First aid kits are supplied in most rentals and in the Community Kitchen. If bedding is involved we have coin-operated laundry facilities in the Community building to begin the washing process. Please notify us of such events.\n\nCOOLERS & CANDLES: Coolers should be left outside so that the condensation doesnt damage our floors. Candles are not allowed due to too many wax spills.\n\nNEARBY: We are just 8 miles from the Berea Pinnacles 6 miles from Get Outside Ky (they rent canoes kayaks SUPs and e-bikes) 3 miles to Tater Knob Pottery 20 minutes to Anglin Falls and a scenic hour from Red River Gorge.

Bio Thermales is generally not crowded however except on major holidays and Sundays.\n\nFood/Meals: The Tree House has a kitchen. There are many restaurants and a good supermarket within a 15 minute drive. Traditional Costa Rican meals can be delivered from a local caterer for very reasonable prices (Costa Rican food is tasty but not spicy). Otherwise for those without cars we can call a taxi or try to synchronize a food shopping trip when we go to town for errands.\n\nThree hours of daylight are needed to safely drive here from the SJO airport before sunset at 5:30 pm. The drive through mountainous cloud forests is splendid in daylight but prone to fog and rain especially at night creating hazardous visibility conditions after dark. Finding our countryside location will also be far easier if you arrive the first time before sunset. If your plane lands in the morning to noon at SJO airport ‚Äì or 11:00 am at Liberia airport -- you can drive here directly from the airport. Otherwise it is safer to book a room near the airport on your first night or ask us to book a private driver and have a rental car delivered at no extra charge.\n\nLast night in Costa Rica:\nDriving directly to the airport on the same day is possible if you book a flight in the afternoon. Please be aware that you must be at the airport 2.5 hours before departure. If you have an early morning departing flight it is basically necessary to stay near the airport on the night before. Guest access Guest access\nGuests enjoy free access to the hot springs swimming pools and rainforest trails from 9 am to 10 pm.\n\nLaundry: we have a full laundry facility and we will do laundry for $5 per load (wash dry and fold). Other things to note Other things to note\nDay visitors and groups are permitted entrance to use the hot springs and cool springs pools from 9 am to 6 pm. There are usually more day visitors on weekends especially Sundays and we recommend booking week days for more tranquility and privacy. If guests book a longer reservation that includes a Sunday we recommend planning a day tour in the many nearby activities on Sundays. Day visitors must leave by 6 pm and only casita and Tree House guests may use the pools after 6 pm and enjoy unlimited access to the pools with the exception of no nighttime use of the forest pools and cleaning schedule as noted above.\n\nWe recommend either ordering a catered dinner in advance for your first evening and/or next morning breakfast or buying and bringing groceries to cook because we are 4 km from the main paved road and driving after dark is highly discouraged until drivers have quite some experience on Costa Rican roads. Also most guests prefer to settle in upon arrival and not to have to get back in the car and drive out to dinner. We provide a Catering Menu to each guest once reserved but the caterer requires advance notice of selected meals and TIMES guests would like meals delivered. We do not have a liquor license and guests must bring their own beer/wine/rum etc. The tap water is safe to drink and we sell soft drinks fruit juices and other non-alcohol beverages snacks and ice cream.,"['What this place offers', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Family', 'Babysitter recommendations', 'Heating and cooling', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'Internet and office', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Coffee maker', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Services', 'Pets allowed', 'Assistance animals are always allowed', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Wifi\nWifi', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Shampoo\nShampoo']",Stanton Kentucky United States,4.0,2.0,1.0,500,4.8,4.9,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.6,19,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/28434120?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8188&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-04-10&check_out=2022-04-17&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=eebf9d56-f119-426a-b39b-9d89928069dc,2.0

145,8925239d-4aac-4972-916e-a70cf2c4c560,Treehouses,Skyview garden Tree House - Casa Kalitero, COVID-19 UPDATE: We\re still open for guests. Place has been cleaned and disinfected with commercial-grade cleaning products.\n#############################\n\nA simple yet comfortable small shaker cabin placed in the middle of the Massanutten Mountain with views to die for of the Shenandoah River and National Park. Wake up to the sight of the magnificent Blue Ridge Mountains and the town of Luray VA from 1500 feet. The space The space\nWe debated long and hard whether to list this place on airbnb. After all this is our hideaway with a view that regretfully only a few will ever get to enjoy. But because we love it so much and in the spirit of the sharing economy we felt compelled to open its doors to others and allow you to experience the wonderful warmth that this small and rustic cabin will bring to your soul your heart and your sight. While here every sense is lifted every smell improved every sound a symphony.\n\nIf you\re looking for modern comfort and the latest gadgets this is not your place. Instead if you want to warm yourself up you\ll need to place wood in the stove. If you want to check the latest stock prices you\ll need to call your broker because Internet is NOT available. If you want to watch TV in your room please look elsewhere.\n\nHowever if you prefer to wake up to the most extraordinary sunrise in your life simply sleep on the futon couch and open up your eyes in the early morning. If you find delight while hearing the buzz of a hummingbird just place a few seeds in the balcony. If you want to reconnect with your inner self seat in one of the shaker rocking chairs pull up your legs and open that book you always wanted to complete. If you\re lucky you may even see a black bear or two roaming around (no worries they are not dangerous).\n\nThe Cabin is located at about 1500 feet overlooking the Shenandoah River the town of Luray and the Blue Ridge Mountains. The view is a feast to the eyesight. But don\t stop there. Visit the Luray Caverns 6 minutes at the bottom of the hills. Hike to your heart\s content on the Massanutten (Stephen) Trail a mile above or in one of the dozens other nearby paths. Bring a road bike and challenge yourself to the top of the mountain. Go horse back riding. Explore the Virginia wine country. Or just...relax.\n\nWelcome to a place where time has finally slowed down! Other things to note Other things to note\nQ & A:\n\nQ: Why do you rent this place?\nA: We use it one month per year at most. Why keep this jewel to ourselves? Please enjoy it as if it\s your place as well.\n\nQ: Why is there no Internet?\nA: I work in the high-tech sector. I am connected 24/7. I wanted a place where time stands still be close to nature and could truly get away from it all. We want to share not only the place but the experience as well.\n\nQ: What if I need something from you?\nA: Just send me a text message or give me a ring. You\ll get my number after your booking is confirmed.\n\nQ: The fridge is very small will we starve to death?\nA: Hey no drama here. Yes the fridge is small but there is also an ice cooler you may use. Simply bring your own ice and please drain it before leaving. That should keep you alive for a bit longer :-)\n\nQ: Should I bring sheets and towels?\nA: No worries. We will provide bedding and towels blankets soap shampoo and toilet paper. If you need anything else please let me know and I will do anything in my power to have it ready before your arrival.\n\nQ. Nice wood stove do I can have to purchase firewood?\nA. No need to do so. I usually provide plenty of firewood for my guests. You may find it in the back deck. Please cover the wood with the tarp after you\re done to protect it from the rain and allow other guests to warm themselves too :-)\n\nQ: I love this place can I extend my stay?\nA: If available sure knock yourself out. Simply get to an internet cafe or use your smart phone and book again. But please contact me beforehand out of courtesy.\n\nQ: Great decoration what style is it?\nA: Shaker style. From wikipedia Shaker furniture is a distinctive style of furniture developed by the United Society of Believers in Christ\s Second Appearing commonly known as Shakers a religious sect that had guiding principles of simplicity utility and honesty. Their beliefs were reflected in the well-made furniture of minimalist designs. We are not shakers but we are guided by the same principles.\n\nQ. What\s the sleeping situation?\nA. Well you\re welcome to sleep any way you\d like :-) But to be more specific there are two bedrooms both with full-size beds. One bedroom has a platform bed with a memory foam mattress and the other one a Murphy bed with a memory foam topper. There are also two full-size futons located next to the stove in the living room. If you\re not into futons there is also a comfy inflatable full-size bed found in the closet where the Murphy bed is. Please take your pick.\n\nQ. There are no bathroom faucets!\nA. Mmm that wasn\t a question but yes they\re there. These faucets and vanity were a DIY project of my own design using copper piping and shut-off valves and reclaimed wood. Just turn the valves one quarter of the way counterclockwise to open the water supply. Pretty cool hugh?\n\nQ. Is the Cabin self-sustainable?\nA. Not yet but I\m working on it. With your booking contribution I created a system to capture rain water to the cistern below (the mountain is dry and water is a precious commodity here) and eventually I will install solar panels on the roof. Currently all waste water goes into a septic tank so as soon as I implement the above steps the Cabin will technically be able to be off-grid.\n\nQ. What other environmental measures have you implemented?\nA. In addition to capturing water from rain and eventually energy from the sun I have renovated the bathroom and kitchen using reclaimed wood some of it from a nearby old farm. The dish and body soaps and most house-cleaning products are environmentally-friendly to help natural decomposition of waste water in the septic system. The floor is made up of natural cork and wood and the entire place was recently re-insulated to improve energy efficiency. If you\d like to know more about our eco-efforts please contact me.\n\nQ. Why are there so many water jugs in the kitchen?\nA. Drinking water in colorful jugs as well as the 5-gal dispenser just outside the kitchen comes from a nearby natural water spring (best tasting water I ever had). I leave plenty of it for you because TAP water is NOT potable. In fact I ask my guests to be mindful of tap water usage because there is no well or city-piped water source. Instead water is collected to a cistern below from rain or trucked in (by me) if need be. It is therefore a precious commodity. Simply shut off faucets when not in use be careful not to leave the toilet running and take shorter showers if possible. That\s it! :-)\n\nQ. How is the house heated?\nA. The main source of heat is the wood stove. You\ll be surprise how efficient this rustic appliance is. Depending on the temp it may take a couple of hours to bring the thermometer up to your standard so exercise a little patience. There is a heat-infused fan and a tea pot on top of the stove. The fan will propagate the heat efficiently and the tea pot (with water) will act as a natural humidifier making you more comfortable. In addition there is a wall heater in the kitchen (dial) and another one in the bathroom (switch) that you can control. Finally a baseboard heater in the entrance hallway will keep the bedrooms (and water pipes) warm. In short you\ll be cozy!\n\nQ. OK so I will be warm in winter. What about the height of the summer heat?\nA. Oh you\ll will be warm in summer alright :-) But seriously there is an old and fairly inefficient AC wall unit in the dining room. There is also a ceiling fan in the living room and another one in one of the bedrooms. I\ve found that opening the windows creates a nice airflow that cools the place down. But if you\re looking for a in-house refrigerator this small cabin may not be for you.\n\nQ. What\s the deal with you being a Superhost?\nA. Well then since you ask...I\m a Superhost because we\re relaxed about our guests despite us having full-time jobs of our own. However I\ve come to be rather fond of that title and I don\t appreciate when a guest leaves a review saying that the place was too isolated or that the place was not what they expected (there\s only about 40 pictures). If a guest does not read the detailed description where I specify the exact distance to places or the meticulous portrayal of the house or whatever then their reviews should be kinder. I truly enjoy 5-star reviews. If there\s something you do not like while here I beg you to let me know and I promise to do what I can to revert your perspective.

We are now having to apply a cleaning fee to all bookings to cover this. Due to the remote nature of the cabin this requires a 20 mile round trip for a cleaner. This is to cover the Sanitisation Clean only and guests are still required to clean up after themselves during their stay. Cleaning products are provided.\n\n* Please Note - For hygiene reasons we dont provide any linens/ bedding including bed sheets pillows duvets and towels (+ tea towels & cleaning cloths). Guests will need to bring their own.\n\nWe are very fond of our little Cabin and have aimed to create somewhere that is well equipped welcoming and as many of our guests say a Home from Home. We certainly love spending time there as an escape from everyday life and we hope you‚Äôll love it as much as we do!\n\nOur self catering cabin was fully refurbished in 2016 and has a fully equipped kitchen & living area with TV & Freesat 2 bedrooms - 1 double & 1 single (note this is a fold out single bed) and a shower room.\n\nThe kitchen should be fully equipped with all you need to make a 3 course dinner or just a nice bacon sarnie in the morning. We try to keep the cupboards stocked with a few basics ‚Äì coffee tea Tomato Ketchup Salt & Pepper etc ‚Äì just in case! There is a small shop on site if you need any basic supplies too.\n\nAt the start of 2017 the cabin had a new fully insulated external cladding added to it & in late 2019 we had the roof insulated also which is keeping everyone warmer in Winter and cooler in Summer. However please remember that cabin is a simple wood construction so it most likely wont be as warm in Winter as your home is so we do ask people to pack a few warmer clothes (& definitely some Slippers!) and maybe use it as an excuse to get cosy under a blanket with someone!\n\nMobile signal has improved drastically in the past few years and we are able to easily stream films & shows to our devices using 4G - perfect for a lazy day in bed! Weve also been able to work remotely here as the connection is strong enough to support video calls.\n\nWe also have a large supply of DVDs and books in the cabin for cold or wet days that you might not want to go out - so stay in and curl up on our big sofas! Guest access Guest access\nThe place is all yours during your stay and in addition to this theres a small shop launderette (great after a day mountain biking or hill walking) & well equipped playground on site. Sadly the pub on site was devastated by a huge fire in Oct 2018 and will be closed for the foreseeable future whilst it is rebuilt. As its Grade II listed though this is taking some time to get sorted.\nWe can recommend alternative venues and taxis. Please ask us for more info or check the guidebook at the Cabin.\n\nLarger shops / supermarkets and all tourist attractions are accessible by car. Most things are about 20 mins drive away (a perfect opportunity to take in the scenery!). There is a dedicated space for car parking right outside the cabin so parking should never be an issue. Other things to note Other things to note\nCheck in is at 3 pm and Check out is at Midday.\n\nAt the cabin itself theres no Wifi currently due to the location. There is a mobile mast on the site now though so Mobile signal has been greatly improved and is good enough to stream Sky Netflix etc or work remotely and do video calls.\n\nDue to restrictions from Snowdonia National Park we are obliged to close for the month of November.\n\nWe require ALL guests to have a history of positive feedback from previous hosts so please note if you are new to Airbnb or have little/no reviews we are unlikely to accept your booking. As we are not on site we like to have extra confidence in the bookings - please dont take this personally!,"['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Mountain view', 'Garden view', 'Valley view', 'Bathroom', 'Hot water', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Washing machine', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Bed linen', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Home safety', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Stove', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Smoking allowed', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Host greets you', 'Cleaning before checkout', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: TV\nTV', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Hair dryer\nHair dryer', 'Unavailable: Smoke alarm\nSmoke alarm', 'There is no smoke alarm on the property.', 'Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'There is no carbon monoxide detector on the property.', 'Unavailable: Shampoo\nShampoo', 'Unavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance', 'Unavailable: Heating\nHeating']",S√£o Martinho das Amoreiras Beja Portugal,2.0,1.0,1.0,14,4.6,4.7,4.9,4.8,4.8,4.8,23,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/24003039?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A8188&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-03-18&check_out=2022-03-25&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=eebf9d56-f119-426a-b39b-9d89928069dc,1.0

No WiFi have a detox: talk walk play games re-charge rest...\nI really do try and make it special for you come and stay :) The space The space\nCOVID UPDATE\nTo keep you your family and myself as safe as possible during this unprecedented time The Wendy House will have to look a little different inside. Following government guidelines anything that cannot be properly cleaned will be removed from the property. Sadly this will mean toys/games/leaflets etc. A different type of welcome pack will also be left. But please be reassured that when you enter The Wendy House it will be a safe environment for you.\n\nThe Wendy House is a traditional 1960s chalet stuffed full of vintage and beautiful things alongside some wonderful vintage photography of Heacham as a seaside resort in the 50s/60s.

It is very suitable for families friends couples and a luxurious base for one...\n\nThe Wendy House and The Summerhouse can be booked together for bigger group gatherings...\n\nI have taken my time renovating this little place which includes a beautiful natural slate floor to the kitchen and shower room wood effect tiled shower shutters to some of the windows quality pocket sprung king size bed with beautiful bed linen - some pillowcases are gorgeous vintage ones.

253,9b96222b-3036-42ce-ae2f-3c70af35db53,Chalets,Standlake Glamping - No2 The Owl Shepherd Hut, The log cabin has been created to give our guests a private peaceful cosy stay with a rustic feeling of getting away from it all. There are stunning views of Dartmoor from your decking where you can enjoy a glass of wine on the sofa surrounded by fur rugs & pillows.\n\nThe combination of Beaches and Moorland are beautiful areas to explore with something for everyone!\n\nAlternatively listen to the crackle of the log burner whilst peacefully watching your favourite movies. The space The space\nYou are situated in a sheltered sunny valley where you can look down on the birds of prey flying around and the lambs chasing each other. It is so very peaceful and relaxing sat on the decking soaking up the view.\n\nIt is great to get away from it all but in case of rainy days there is also a wall mounted TV which has no areal only TV via the internet so you can enjoy net flicks/amazon prime etc. Occasionally we can have a poor signal due to being so rural but most of the time it works fine! There is WIFI in the Log Cabin.\n\nThe log cabin is a 20minute walk outside the village and quite rural. Take care driving on the lanes as they are quite narrow and challenging at times. Late summer into Autumn is when the farmers cut the hedges which can be frustrating as this reduces the beautiful view. But this is not for long and the peace and tranquillity is still surrounding you.\n\nDogs are very welcome; it is the perfect place for wonderful walks across Dartmoor National Park. The garden should be secure and private for them unless they are small enough to climb through the gate! Please let me know if you are bringing one on your booking. There is a small charge of ¬£10 per stay if you have one or two dogs (if you have more than two dogs I would be grateful if you would contact me first).\n\nThere is an outdoor bath for two in a private garden so you can look up at the stars.\nThis is my favourite place but it is not for everyone! This is part of your log cabin and included in the price.\n\nThere is a hot tub next door which is available occasionally if my cottage is not booked.\nPlease feel free to ask and if it is available it is ¬£25 for a two hour session. I will only be able to confirm its availability when you have arrived.\nMy guest tell me they are loving the bath and would rather it to the hot tub! Other things to note Other things to note\nWell behaved Dogs are very welcome. There is a hose and a dog gate to help you keep them clean and dry. If you could bring your own dog beds and keep them off your bed and the sofa I would be most grateful.\n\nThe double sofa bed is small which is why I have allowed for only one guest but it can fit two. If you want a fourth person to stay it is an extra ¬£10 a night.\n\nIf you do use the sofa bed I am afraid you cannot use the log burning stove as the bed gets too close - you do not need it for heating as there is a radiator anyway - but it looks and smells lovely if there is just two of you.\n\nThere is an outside field kitchen under cover which consists of an small oven two hot plates and a chicken rotisserie (which is amazing!). I am very grateful if you could leave this clean on departure to avoid a cleaning fee. There is a small combination microwave/cooker/grill inside the log cabin too.\n\nThe bathroom is heated by the sun and has a wonderfully hot shower in an open rustic wet room - it is surprisingly pleasurable! The Eco Loo is a type of waterless toilet that separates urine from solid waste. Urine can is diverted through a flexible pipe to an external soak away area. This is cleaned and made fresh for all my guests and is environmentally friendly.\n\nYou have your own two person external bath which is hidden away in your private garden with fairy lights and candles - a wonderful experience you simply must try!\n\nThere is a fire pit that you can sit around in your garden you will need to bring your own logs for this. Great for roasting marshmallows and can be used to bbq food but you will need to bring your own charcoal and there is no temperature control so can be challenging...\n\nOccasionally I rent out my cottage next door too.,"['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Garden view', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Shampoo', 'Conditioner', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Bed linen', 'Cotton linen', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Entertainment', 'TV', 'Heating and cooling', 'Ceiling fan', 'Radiant heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Caple refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Kettle', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Barbecue utensils', 'Grill, charcoal, bamboo skewers/iron skewers, etc.', 'Coffee', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard ‚Äì Not fully fenced', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'BBQ grill', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Private hot tub', 'Services', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning', 'Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'Host has indicated that no carbon monoxide detector is necessary.

That is why we provide you with a nice stereo system and traditional Balinese music equipment.\nHideout is also a shelter for a Kikky cat which is super cute and cuddly. You can also meet our friendly Hoki dog. They are the best security for night-time. Dont book Hideouts if you have an allergy or if you dont want to be close to the animals.\n\nYou can experience authentic Balinese lifestyle cultural habits and observe many wonderful things in nature. Especially in the river which is sometimes used for cleansing ceremonies and baths. Its a wonderful thing to experience.\n\nYou can‚Äôt lock the bamboo house you can close the garden gate from the inside.\n\nFIRST TIME IN THE JUNGLE?\nHideout is part of local nature our cleaning standards are at the highest but that doesnt stop occasional insect furry caterpillar (that should have a sign - do not touch) frog snake or mouse from visiting the house. Please consider this before booking and do not book this house if you are not prepared for an occasional encounter. We are immersed in nature. :) Animals are friends not enemies.\n\nWe urge you to always turn your lights on in the night when moving around the house or visiting the bathroom.\n\nDid you know that a spider can make a new web in under 1 hour? With our biggest efforts to keep the houses perfect and insect free you have to expect that there will be some spiders some bugs and some mosquitos. That is just nature and we cant do anything more for it. If you dont feel comfortable with that it is better to book a different type of accommodation than a bamboo house.\nThe Internet is very poor and sometimes not working at all. We recommend being prepared for the off-the-grid experience.\n\nABOUT US\nWe are not a hotel we dont offer hotel services or 24/7 reception. We are a true Airbnb experience. :) We are here for you daily from 8am - 8pm.

Check-out by 11am.\n\nLOCATION\nPlease take a careful look at the map we are over 90 minutes away from the Ubud and 2 hours from the city of Denpasar and the international airport. :)\nThe closest city is Amlapura 30min away. There is no night-life here. No bars clubs coffee houses or shops with imported products. We are this far from the city by choice. In the middle of rice fields with a calm setting next to the running river.\n\nHideout is within walking distance from a resort where you can have a lovely dinner in the restaurant with an unforgettable view of Gunung Agung.

Campuhan is Balinese term for a place where two rivers meet. This place is regarded by locals as a holy place for centuries. Its a source of holy water for ceremonies and cleansing the body and spirit. During your stay you will have the opportunity to observe Balinese during their ceremonies and baths.

Dont let the unusual openness of the space deter you this is an experience you wont soon forget.Bali 101:\nWelcome to Bali no this is not like where you are coming from. To hopefully enhance your experience we want to provide you with a bit of cultural context. People often feel disappointed when they try to make Bali what they are familiar with. We hope by describing a few scenarios that this helps as Bali has things about it that may be very different than you are used to.\n1. ‚ÄúThere is a lizard staring at me from the ceiling who pooped on the floor and there are ants crawling along the wall in the bathroom‚Äù The outdoors will come inside. Crickets spiders and certainly a resident gecko and wasps will all join you in your living space. No matter how fancy the villa there is no keeping them out. Given that all of our bathrooms are open air this is something to embrace as part of the experience and not be afraid as they are all harmless.\n2. ‚ÄúI can hear roosters and dogs and the temple and even the occasional pig being sacrificed at midnight oh and the crickets are too loud to sleep.‚Äù Yes indeed all true. When I think of Bali I think of roosters they are very proud of their fighting cocks and spend a great deal of time with them often keeping them quite close to living spaces so your neighbor may very well have one. our neighbor certainly has both and his dog barks a lot and has attempted to scare away many a guest but dont be afraid he is harmless. The temple is a charming sound that echo thru the night and adds the to atmosphere but it can be less charming when they begin to sacrifice pigs at midnight. Peaceful Bali? Well its all a matter of perspective bali is here to be itself not just to be a peaceful place for you to relax enjoy these new and unique sounds as part of the atmosphere and dont expect it to be an instagram photo it is a real living place.\n3. ‚ÄúAn old lady with a machete and no shirt on just wandered into my living room‚Äù Balinese have a very different relationship to personal privacy than we do. It is not uncommon for neighbors or rice-field farms to wander into your space and personal property. because they are curious about you or simply because they want to borrow your sugar. They may not even ask as they would imagine you would do exactly the same. This can be very startling at first and takes some getting used to. You are welcome to ask them to leave but do keep in mind they are more than likely not there to harm you just used to sharing personal space.\n\n4. ‚ÄúThere are naked people in the stream by the house‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt very many years ago that all Balinese women were topless as their normal daily attire. Now only the traditional old women still maintain this style of dress but it is still very common to see people publicly bathing in ricefield streams naked. You may even see this from your front porch. Don‚Äôt be alarmed this normal here and they will not even feel embarrassed if you wave \uf04a\n5. ‚ÄúThe guy tried to over charge me‚Äù there is a very different relationship to money here. Think of it as a tug of war with a rope in the middle it‚Äôs not that they are trying to steal from you or cheat you or have anything against you at all they are just pulling on the rope to get as much money as they can if you don‚Äôt tug back then they won. Don‚Äôt get angry or feel the need to have hurt feelings just negotiate calmly to lower the price to something fairer. Negotiate everything in every situation you will use these skills later when you need to ask for a raise with your boss. ;)\n6. ‚Äúeverything is damp‚Äù yes this is the tropics and especially during the rainy season everything can feel a bit damp and can mildew quickly even within a day. If your clothes need fresh laundering after being in a suitcase or if the sheets need to be changed for this reason just let us know and we will assist you.\nWe hope these scenarios help you to be prepared if you face them and feel free to let us know should you need additional help navigating in this new environment. Also please be aware that this is a house with two cats who live there we very much want to host people who are cat friendly as the cats are very much running the resort and we want you to be able to include them in your stay.,"['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Garden view', 'Bathroom', 'Bath', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', ""Neals Yard, children's shampoo and conditioner shampoo"", 'Neals Yard conditioner', 'Neals Yard body soap', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Egyptian cotton linen', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Iron', 'Clothes drying rack', 'Clothes storage: chest of drawers, wardrobe and wardrobe', 'Entertainment', 'Ethernet connection', '52"" HDTV with standard cable/satellite', 'Bluetooth sound system', 'Ping pong table', 'Pool table', 'Books and reading material', 'Family', 'Children‚Äôs books and toys for ages 0‚Äì2 years old, 2‚Äì5 years old, 5‚Äì10 years old and 10+ years old', 'High chair', 'Baby bath', 'Children‚Äôs tableware', 'Board games', 'Babysitter recommendations', 'Heating and cooling', 'Indoor fireplace', 'Portable fans', 'Heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'Fire extinguisher', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Freezer', 'Dishwasher', 'Stove', 'Oven', 'Kettle', 'Coffee maker', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Barbecue utensils', 'Grill, charcoal, bamboo skewers/iron skewers, etc.', 'Coffee', 'Dining table', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Launderette nearby', 'Outdoor', 'Private patio or balcony', 'Private backyard ‚Äì Not fully fenced', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'BBQ grill', 'Bikes', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Washing machine\nWashing machine', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning']",Hampshire England United Kingdom,6.0,5.0,2.5,200,5.0,4.9,5.0,4.9,5.0,4.8,68,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/13745592?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A677&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-05-16&check_out=2022-05-23&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=0b044c1c-8d17-4b03-bffb-5de13ff710bc,2.0

482,864807de-cae2-4be5-b91e-7c79dd998c85,Amazing pools,"Shrove, rural idyll with breakfast hamper", Approximately 260 sq ft earth sheltered structure within our permaculture-based sustainable off-grid village. It is one of a kind in architecture and theme with colored bottles built into the wall stained glass windows center tree pillar with atrium windows above and medieval Celtic Cross above the Hobbit Hole (outside and atop) give it a Hobbit Church feel. The space The space\nHeads up -- one of our Hobbit front door hinges just broke. darn it. Just a heads up. It usually takes a couple weeks to get a welder out here for such fixits.\n\nThis is a primitive cabin it DOES have running water but NO electricity (you bring your own candles BYOC). Common facilities (kitchen and bath) being shared with the larger community about 200 yds away.\n\n*Just so everyone knows during heavy rains in our RainForest winter months sometimes the floor can get a little wet and the underground cave can be damp --Utilizing the wood stove is ideal (please bring some firewood) keeps it drier and warmer.\n\nBreakfast nook has a Hobbit mushroom table and there is a comfy sky chair suspended for luxuriating.\n\nBuilt into the side of a mountain with a seasonal spring (there are springs everywhere here in the mountainous rain forest) that runs through the house -- on purpose -- so there is often the sound of a babbling brook in the HH November thru May.\n\nIf you are looking for a unique experience in a beautiful natural area and would like to experience life in an off-grid sustainable permaculture-focused ecovillage - and all the rough roads dirt mud insects messes barking dogs mosquitos bees mice early morning roosters communal living composting toilets ongoing construction projects in remote wilderness - then we invite you join us in our mountain village!\n\nOur property encompasses 160 acres of pristine natural wilderness in Northern California\s beautiful Smith River canyon - home of the only un-dammed river in the state. Lush fern-encrusted hillsides slope down to countless spring-fed streams teeming with wildlife from cute caterpillars to (also cute sometimes!) black bears. Accessible only by forestry road from scenic Redwoon Hwy (CA-199) this is an opportunity to experience our responsible natural relationship with Mother Earth.\n\nThis location is very beautiful and quite remote so please be sure you\ve read through the full description and are prepared for certain elements of roughing it and adventure travel. The Village is also a work-in-progress so we are likely to be working and there may be construction dirt and messes around!\n\nAmenities:\n\nBEDDING. It seems weird and unnecessary to me honestly but (bending to some COVID requests) we are asking you to bring your own sheets/sleeping bags etc. There will be a mattress pad blanket and some sheets in a drawer if you really need/want them. We\ll call it a rustic cabin theme instead of a paranoid germophobe motif.\n\n‚Ä¢Lighting / Electricity: Your cabin does not have electricity; we try to keep a flashlight lantern and/or candle available for your use -- but we recommend that you bring your own lights.\n‚Ä¢Kitchen: The outdoor kitchen about 200yds away from the Hobbit Hole has a small propane camping stove and plenty of pots pans and utensils for your use. We do not have refrigeration but we do have a freezer (with ice packs) and coolers for storing food.\n‚Ä¢Bathrooms: We use composting toilets (buckets with seats); there is an indoor toilet in the bathhouse. Hot shower in the sauna/bathhouse. It is about 200 yds on average away from most of our cabins\n‚Ä¢(Lack of) Phone / Internet: Some Verizon and US Cellular service is available but AT&T and T-Mobile do not service our area. We do not have wifi.\n\nThe Great Outdoors:\n‚Ä¢Domestic animals: Between the three dogs who run around at night chasing forest creatures springtime frog concerts and the early-rising chickens it is likely that there will be some animal noises occurring at unpredictable moments during the night and day.\n‚Ä¢Wild animals: There are various of these that live in the forest including skunks chipmunks foxes black bears and many birds and insects. Since we have dogs and people around the wild animals tend to keep their distance from the areas that we use. If you are lucky you might spot a black bear on a hike; they are basically like big raccoons and prefer to run away from humans.\n\nIf you are looking for a unique experience and up for rustic accommodations with a few off-grid perks we welcome you to join us in our mountain paradise! Guest access Guest access\nThere is no key (or lock) to the Hobbit Hole. Just head up (the road) to the Lower Village common area. The Hobbit Hole is the first structure -- before the treehouse -- and just past the parking area on the right. Someone will probably be there to show you about the common areas -- otherwise just make yourself at home. It\s casual not formal.\n\nThe Hobbit House is quite private and the furthest away from amenities in our Village. We provide a portable composting toilet. Our dining hall bath house (with shower bidet and fancier indoor toilet) is about 200 yds away.\nThere are plenty trails to hike a swimming hole and garden benches and porch swings to enjoy the view.\n\nThe host (Dan) is sometimes around sometimes not often busy doing stuff so it\s all pretty straight forward check in yourself (no key or lock) make yourself at home community areas are obvious. But there\s almost always someone around (other residents intern woofers) to answer questions if you have them.\n\nThere is a wood-fired sauna (usable November thru May) large organic garden and edible landscaping chicken and goat pens other animal residents include dogs cats chickens fish and frogs.\n\nFrom your cabin you are welcome to wander at will amongst our 160 acres of mostly steep forested land and enjoy the streams and waterfalls leading into Little Jones Creek. A stroll down the driveway and back along the forestry road is a beautiful hike in itself where you could easily spend all day in the company of only quiet woodland creatures.\n\nWe also offer custom bodywork sessions - holistic chiropractic and massage - more info available on request. Other things to note Other things to note\nDriving here: You do NOT need 4WD or any special vehicle to reach our property. We drive in and out regularly in our small Honda hatchback and have had hundreds of visitors drive up in their regular cars. Indeed the forestry road has a few potholes worth slowing to 5mph but otherwise can be driven at 20mph. The rainy winter season creates puddles but actually better traction than in summer counter intuitively. The bridge ramps narrow and all you need to do is drive it slowly consciously. Pretty easy.\n\nNote: Plenty of people have very relaxing enjoyable satisfying experiences here in our sustainable culture experiment but this happens only when reality exceeds expectations. This is where I try to talk everyone out of coming to stay with us -- MMV is NOTHING like a resort or the Marriott hotel. Think some crazy combination of camping/glamping at a rugged mountainous off-grid remote farm and sustainable community. There may be a compost pile outside your cabin after we weed the the beds around it. Our goats chickens or dogs may wake you in the morning. There are all kinds of critters here including but not limited to spiders and bears and all in between. We live here and make messes undertake all kinds of projects including big building projects sometimes. It is NOT polished not always tidy (although we really try) convenient or even (sometimes) comfortable. You may have to split your own firewood. There is plenty of raw beauty and these forementioned functionalities are how it is here as we continue working towards Shangri La!\nWe love our visitors and appreciate them -- if you want to understand more about our project -- visit join and/or support us -- search Maitreya Mountain Village,"['What this place offers', 'Scenic views', 'Pool view', 'Valley view', 'Bathroom', 'Hair dryer', 'Cleaning products', 'Eden shampoo', 'Eden body soap', 'Hot water', 'Shower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry', 'Free washer ‚Äì In building', 'Essentials', 'Towels, bed sheets, soap and toilet paper', 'Hangers', 'Bed linen', 'Cotton John Lewis/ Laura Ashley linen', 'Extra pillows and blankets', 'Room-darkening shades', 'Iron', 'Clothes drying rack', 'Clothes storage: chest of drawers', 'Entertainment', '22"" HDTV with Fire TV', 'Books and reading material', 'Family', 'Travel cot', 'High chair', 'Board games', 'Heating and cooling', 'Central heating', 'Home safety', 'Smoke alarm', 'Carbon monoxide alarm', 'First aid kit', 'Internet and office', 'Wifi', 'Dedicated workspace: table', 'A desk or table with a chair and space for a laptop.', 'Kitchen and dining', 'Kitchen', 'Space where guests can cook their own meals', 'Refrigerator', 'Microwave', 'Cooking basics', 'Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper', 'Dishes and silverware', 'Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.', 'Mini fridge', 'Stove', 'Oven', 'Kettle', 'Coffee maker', 'Wine glasses', 'Toaster', 'Baking sheet', 'Coffee', 'Dining table', 'Location features', 'Private entrance', 'Separate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor', 'Patio or balcony', 'Garden', 'An open space on the property usually covered in grass', 'Fire pit', 'Outdoor furniture', 'Outdoor dining area', 'Bikes', 'Parking and facilities', 'Free parking on premises', 'Free on-street parking', 'Private outdoor pool', 'Services', 'Luggage drop-off allowed', ""For guests' convenience when they are arriving early or departing late"", 'Breakfast', 'Breakfast is provided', 'Long-term stays allowed', 'Allow stays of 28 days or more', 'Self check-in', 'Lockbox', 'Not included', 'Unavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property', 'Unavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning']",Chedworth Cheltenham England United Kingdom,2.0,2.0,1.5,84,5.0,4.9,5.0,4.9,5.0,4.9,58,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4665450?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A677&children=0&infants=0&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2022-04-01&check_out=2022-04-08&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=0b044c1c-8d17-4b03-bffb-5de13ff710bc,1.0

Here you are in the forest but not the dense part and it overlooks green space and trails. Retreat re-wind and re-fuel by yourself or with your significant other. Maximum of TWO people and both must be adults.\nImportant to NOTE: NO Washroom in the Cabin. There is a nice washroom with a shower but it is NOT inside the cabin.

523,b5c8f5d8-02ec-492b-b253-9a4dbea1a044,Amazing pools,"Elm Park Barn, Chewton Keynsham, BS31 2SS", Come experience glamping at its finest in our beautiful yome! (FYI glamping is still camping just a little more comfy!) Locally made a yome is a yurt/geodesic dome hybrid. You‚Äôll love the ultra comfortable queen mattress mini kitchen dining area and the warmth of the propane heater*! Enjoy all the comforts of home plus the adventure of camping. Nestled in the woods yet only 10 minutes from downtown Weaverville 10 minutes from the Blue Ridge Parkway and 20 minutes from Asheville. The space The space\nEmbrace glamping to the fullest! Our yome is off-grid: no WiFi no electricity no running water and spotty cell service. Instead we have battery-powered LED lights solar lights and candles providing mood lighting - if you need bright lights I suggest bringing a lantern - a solar shower with privacy enclosure and a very clean porta-John for your use.\n\nThere is a small grill that is BYOB - bring your own briquets :) (and lighter fluid). I do provide tongs.\n\nThe mini-kitchen consists of a 2-burner propane stove (with propane) frying pan tea kettle French press cooking utensils dishes/silverware grater peeler wine key organic coffee organic olive oil sugar creamer salt & pepper.\n\nThe driveway is not very long but it is gravel steep in places and can be very bumpy! Careful if your car is low to the ground! Any car will be able to make it - we have a Jetta and a Camry in our family - but those with AWD/4WD will certainly have an easier time.\n\nWe have two dogs that have free reign of our property including at night. While they fancy themselves watchdogs - and are sure to cause a ruckus when they first meet you - they are the biggest sweethearts and nothing to be afraid of! Nellie is the small one and Maisie is the larger.\n\nOur house is visible from the yome however there is much more distance - about 150 feet - than you would find between sites in a campground. Or a neighborhood!\n\nPlease keep in mind that because this is a tent you will be more subject to the elements/nature that you would be in a conditioned space. So check the weather before you come and dress/pack accordingly! Expect bugs spiders etc... Despite the fact that I remove all of them each time I prepare the yome for a guest some will inevitably find their way back in.\n\n*The propane heater is provided October-March.

Large kitchen open plan space; king bed in main living area queen bed in open loft. Retreat-writing meditation yoga dancing playing fun! Location-location!! 4 miles to town The space The space\nArchitecturally elegant and unique design situated with beautiful views. This was a big home that has been duplex-ed and is about 1100 square feet. It was designed for privacy so the entry door for the other home is on the opposite side of the house from where you enter. Very peaceful and quiet - the only house on the street. I call the area country suburbia with houses peppered in the neighborhood about 1/4 mile away. This is a monolithic dome which means a huge balloon was blown up and sprayed with concrete before the balloon was popped. That part of the house is 34 ft diameter with rustic wooden floors & two 5 1/2 ft round windows over looking great views & yard. (The yard is not totally secure for pet safety.) Large kitchen very roomy open plan space; king bed/queen bed in the loft a smart TV and selection of DVDs for your entertainment. The picture shows a ladder going to the loft but it is now a stair case. The loft has an artsy 2 1/2 foot picket fence as a wall. There is sight privacy but due to it being a half wall there is no sound privacy. Parents note: Please look at the pictures to decide if this room is child-safe for your needs. About 2 % of folks decide its not right for them.I imagine it should be no problem unless they are climbers when youre not looking! Please ask for details if youre unsure. This is a wonderful space for retreats writing meditation yoga dancing playing fun! The sister dome is about 1000 square feet - and renting both sides is excellent for smallish events/retreats.

Our grandpa a home builder designed this rustic house as a masterpiece for his family. He wanted it to be part of nature so he fit it between trees and inside left exposed the massive sandstone slab on which it‚Äôs built. This large house has entertained our family and friends for generations and we‚Äôre thrilled that now you can share it with yours too. Be in nature but minutes from downtown! The space The space\nOur grandpa designed and built this unique home in a way that captures the rugged terrain on which it sits and compliments the stunning natural beauty of the Colorado National Monument that serves as the backdrop. He made it so every room has its own stunning view. Look closely at the photos to see the rock and wood detail throughout. The sandstone slab of the hill on which it‚Äôs built actually makes up the entire wall of the downstairs family room and the floor of the room above. Grandpa had artistic vision creativity and the craftsmanship to put it all together and he built this house from his heart. (He was still building furniture for us well into his 90s!). It has served as a cherished place for family gatherings and we invite you to enjoy your vacation the way we have enjoyed this home throughout the generations. Have breakfast in the kitchen or on the giant deck while enjoying unobstructed views of the Colorado National Monument and the way the morning sun hits the red rocks. Spend evenings by the massive fireplace watching the sun set over the Bookcliffs and the Grand Valley. During the summers you might catch a lightning storm over the grand valley as the thunder echoes off the massive canyon walls behind the house. We also have a charcoal grill so you can BBQ outside and take in the views from the deck. Take leisurely walks through the neighborhood or drive/bike to get to everything that Grand Junction has to offer. (See list below!)\n\nSee our video tour: search House on the Rock and Grand Junction on that big video platform that everyone uses (stated in a way that gets around a ban on mentioning websites here). :)\n\nWhile most of the home furnishings are rustic and cozy in a way that preserves the years of fond memories we made sure you had enough upgraded guest amenities to make your stay as comfy as can be: we just remodeled our showers have hotel-quality linens plush towels and plenty of toiletries. You get to enjoy a vacation with maybe the most gorgeous views in the Grand Valley in a house full of charmingly-old stuff spanning generations but you still get to sleep as if you were staying in a great hotel.\n\nPlease note- we try our absolute best to keep the house clean for you and all of our future guests.

The location is perfect - steps away from a gorgeous beach and lovely walks in both directions.

The communication and welcome we received from Roger was exceptional and most definitely set the tone for a special week on the island. Thank you Roger! Sally & Family 30th October 2021\n\nThank you for renting us your holiday home we had a lovely two weeks. The location is superb and fell in love with Seaview. Karen & Adrian 10th October 2021\n\nMy parents had a wonderful weeks stay here on their first holiday in 8 years! Roger was really helpful and easy to communicate with and we were grateful for the discount booking ferry tickets. Very nice bedlinen and towels and fully equipped accommodation. Had everything needed. The place was clean and quiet and location is faultless. My parents enjoyed long evenings sat on the decking enjoying sea views. Would not hesitate to recommend to others or stay here ourselves again. Viktoria 23rd September 2021\n\nWhat a great place! Would highly recommend. The deck area in front of the house has a beautiful view over the beach towards Portsmouth. We had a great time with our 2 year old son popping over to the beach and back all throughout our stay. Roger was the perfect host helped with ferry bookings and told me everything I needed. Gary and family 19th July 2021\n\nA nicely decorated tasteful cosy cottage just by a wide spanning beach. There are a number of relatively close shops if you dont mind a short walk through the nice seaside town of Seaview. The place itself was well fitted with a full kitchen and all the bits and bobs you need on holiday. There are a multitude of sites to visit around the property with a beautiful nature reserve just a hundred metres from the front door. The shore changes from sandy beaches to shingle beaches with a welcoming setting no matter your preference. Inside The Beach Side youll find all you need with a TV and stable WiFi . The two bedrooms were comfortable and quiet at night and the living space has a modern sliding window out onto the communal gardens and the path out to the sea (only 30m or so away). Overall a great place to stay while you explore what the Isle has to offer. Monica 12th July 2021\n\nWe had a lovely stay on the Isle of Wight. The accommodation was perfect for our needs.
